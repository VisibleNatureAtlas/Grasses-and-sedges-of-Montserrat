# Visible Nature Atlas: Grasses and sedges of Montserrat

This is a volume in the **Visible Nature Atlas** series — an open, data-driven collection of biodiversity books covering the flora and fauna of specific regions worldwide.

## About this atlas

This atlas focuses on the **grasses (Poaceae) and sedges (Cyperaceae)** of **Montserrat**, a small British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean Lesser Antilles. Despite its modest size (102 km²), Montserrat harbours a rich diversity of native and introduced grass and sedge species.

All data is sourced from open, freely available biodiversity databases:

- **[GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)** — the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, aggregating occurrence records from herbaria, field observations, and citizen science
- **[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)** — providing taxonomic information, institutional data, and links to additional resources
- **[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/)** — field observations with photographs
- **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/)** — species introductions and background information

## Structure of this book

The atlas is organised in two parts:

**Part 1 — Collections:** Records organised by the herbaria, botanical gardens, and observers that contributed observations from Montserrat.

**Part 2 — Taxa:** Each grass and sedge species gets its own chapter with:
- A brief species description (from Wikipedia)
- A map of worldwide observations (from GBIF via OpenStreetMap)
- Specimen photographs linked to original GBIF occurrence records

## About the Visible Nature Atlas series

The Visible Nature Atlas series aims to make biodiversity data accessible to a broad audience — from researchers to curious naturalists — by combining open linked data with modern web publishing tools. Each volume covers a specific taxon group or geographic area.

This atlas was generated from open data using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), with all source code and data available on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrawaagmeester/Grasses-and-sedges-of-Montserrat).

## Data and reproducibility

All data used in this atlas is available under open licenses. The complete pipeline — from raw GBIF download to the published book — is documented in `inspectData.ipynb` and can be reproduced by anyone.

```{note}
Observation maps on species pages show worldwide GBIF records for each species, helping to understand the species' global distribution in addition to its presence on Montserrat.
